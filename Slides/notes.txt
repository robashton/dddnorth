An introduction to node.js

0) Some history
	- Ryan Dahl presents node.js @ conference
	- Joyent buy Ryan and node
	- Everyone starts drinking the kool aid

1) Node
	- Open source
	- Non blocking server using a single instance of V8 per node process
	- Single thread of execution, events drive everything
	- all APIs are non-blocking, 'go do this, notify me when you're done'
	- Minimal overhead per connection
	- Oh, and it's Javascript.

	
2) Node - what is it good for?
	- Fibonacci series calculation (strike-through - and a joke about absolutely nothing if you read certain intarweb troll posts)
	- List of internet-found use cases
		- Uber taxi cabs
		- Chat server thingy
		- Video encoding
		- Multiplayer gaming
		
Note that video encoding is not IO bound, but it's a long running process, we can fire up an instance per encode job
If you want to do rails development and you don't like Javascript, then use Ruby on Rails, 
just building websites on top of Express is a bit of a waste anyway

3) Some examples (note: pre-created examples if internet flakes out/doesn't work)
	- Getting started (installing node)
	- Getting started (installing NPM)
	- Http server hello world
	- socketio chat example
		- Add socketio to packages.xml and do an NPM install
	- Sharing code twixt client + server (simple domain + validation)
	
4) Super secret bonus round
	- WebGL demo of hover-battles (hosted on macbook)
	
5) Notes: (While leaving battles going)
	- If you don't like Javascript, there is always coffeescript
		- Most core node devs make fun of CS because they're used to JS now and are comfortable that it's just a language
	- The philosophy of node dev is typically one of simplicity
	 	- no meta programming
		- minimal abstraction
		- writing code to solve specific problems
	- Help is at hand
		- Mailing list
		- Nodejitsu
	- Hosting options
	 	- Heroku
		- Nodejitsu
		- Joyent
